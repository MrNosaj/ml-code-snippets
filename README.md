Reusable code blocks for machine learning projects.

# ML Code Snippets Repository

Welcome to the ML Code Snippets Repository! This repository is your go-to resource for reusable machine learning code blocks. Whether you're starting a new project or looking to streamline your existing workflows, these snippets are designed to save you time and effort.

## Standard ML Imports Block

The `standard_ml_imports.py` file contains a comprehensive list of import statements that cover the essentials for most machine learning projects. These imports include libraries for data manipulation, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

### How to Use

To use the standard ML imports block in your project, simply download the `standard_ml_imports.py` file from this repository and include it in your project's working directory. Then, in your main project file, you can load these imports with the following line of code:

```python
from standard_ml_imports import *
```

This will give you immediate access to all the standard libraries and functions needed for a typical machine learning project, without cluttering your code with multiple import statements.

### When It's Useful

This import block is particularly useful when:
- You're setting up a new machine learning project and want to quickly get started with the essentials.
- You want to ensure consistency across multiple projects by using a standard set of libraries and functions.
- You're teaching or sharing code with others and want to provide a comprehensive yet simple setup.

### Contributing

If you have suggestions for additional imports that could be universally useful for machine learning projects, or if you've identified improvements to our current setup, we encourage contributions! Please feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
